### :octocat: Hi there 👋

😄 My name is Jing, and I'm in my Ph.D. journey in Computer Science.
- I'm currently working on an intelligent security framework for the IoT ecosystem utilizing machine learning and deep learning. 
- In order to implement this security model, a wide range of multidisciplinary expertise including cyber security, the Internet of things, intrusion detection and prevention, anomaly detection, machine learning, and deep learning must be studied and put into practice.
- Therefore, thanks to the GitHub provides the playground for me to create and maintain multiple knowledge repositories.

📚 Here are some topics in my repos:

- 📚 [The Things of Ph.D. Journey](https://github.com/goldboy225/PhD-Journey): All the things involving research knowledge, publication, practical skills, awesome courses, domain area expertise, and all the necessary and interesting things will be collected and synthesized for those who want to try and pursue the Ph.D. journey (will keep updating).
- 📚 [Daily Literature Review](https://github.com/goldboy225/PhD-Journey/blob/main/Literatures%20Daily.md): This is the repository for daily literature reviews to collect the-state-of-the art ideas and methodologies in academia and provide future research directions.
- 🔭 [AI Tools for Research](https://github.com/goldboy225/AI-Tools-for-Research): Here I keep collecting the AI tools and sharing the experience to boost our research works.
- 📫 [ChatGPT for Research](https://github.com/goldboy225/ChatGPT-for-Research): Repo for the stuff created by ChatGPT, let's see how ChatGPT can help with research work.
- 🌱 [Construction of IoT Security Frameworks](https://github.com/goldboy225/Intelligent-IoT-Security-Frameworks): This is the coding practice repo for constructing end-to-end machine learning and deep learning-based security frameworks for IoT security.
- 👯 [Awesome AI One-Click-Deployment](https://github.com/goldboy225/Awesome-AI-One-Click-Deployment): This is the repo for one-click or simple deployment of AI projects and applications, such as Auto-GPT, Auto-GPT-NextWeb etc.
- 📫 [Awesome ML for Cybersecurity](https://github.com/goldboy225/awesome-ml-for-cybersecurity): A curated list of amazingly awesome tools and resources related to the use of machine learning for cyber security.
