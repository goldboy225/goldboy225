### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


ðŸ˜„ My name is Jing, and I'm pursuing PhD in computer science in UTM.
- I'm currently working on an intelligent security framework for the IoT ecosystem utilising machine learning and deep learning. 
- In order to implement this security model, a wide range of multidisciplinary expertise including cyber security, the internet of things, intrusion detection and prevention, anomaly detection, machine learning, and deep learning must be studied and put into practise.
- Therefore, thanks to the github to provide the playground for me to create and maintain multiple knowledge repositories.

ðŸ“š Here are some topics in my repos:

- ðŸ“š [The Things of PhD Journey](https://github.com/goldboy225/PhD-Journey): All the things involving research knowledge, publication, practical skills, awesome courses, domain area expertise, and all the necessary and interesting things will be collected and synthesized for who want to try and pursue the PhD journey (will keep updating).
- ðŸ”­ [Code Base for Research](https://github.com/goldboy225/Code-Base-for-Research): The coding practice involving data cleaning, data visualization, exploration data analysis, feature selection, machine learning and deep learning.
- ðŸŒ± [Data Exploration Analysis](https://github.com/goldboy225/Python_EDA): This is EDA coding practice repo and is the part of the materials for the subject High Performance Data Processing by my supervisor.
- ðŸ‘¯ [Cyber Security](https://github.com/goldboy225/cyber-security): This is the coding repo related to cyber security involving network intrusion detection using well-known datasets like KDD cup â€˜99, NSL-KDD, UNSW_NB15.
- ðŸ¤” [Awesome Machine Learning](https://github.com/goldboy225/awesome-machine-learning): A curated list of awesome Machine Learning frameworks, libraries and software.
- ðŸ“« [Awesome ML for Cybersecurity](https://github.com/goldboy225/awesome-ml-for-cybersecurity): A curated list of amazingly awesome tools and resources related to the use of machine learning for cyber security.
