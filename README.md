### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


ðŸ˜„ My name is Jing, and I'm pursuing PhD in computer science in UTM.
- I'm currently working on an intelligent security framework for the IoT ecosystem utilising machine learning and deep learning. 
- In order to implement this security model, a wide range of multidisciplinary expertise including cyber security, the internet of things, intrusion detection and prevention, anomaly detection, machine learning, and deep learning must be studied and put into practise.
- Therefore, thanks to the github to provide the playground for me to create and maintain multiple knowledge repositories.

ðŸ“š Here are some topics in my repos:

- ðŸ”­ [Code Base for Research](https://github.com/goldboy225/Code-Base-for-Research): The coding practice involving data cleaning, data visualization, exploration data analysis, feature selection, machine learning and deep learning.
- ðŸŒ± [Data Exploration Analysis](https://github.com/goldboy225/Python_EDA): This is EDA coding practice repo and is the part of the materials for the subject High Performance Data Processing by my supervisor.
- ðŸ‘¯ [Cyber Security](https://github.com/goldboy225/cyber-security): This is the coding repo related to cyber security involving network intrusion detection using well-known datasets like KDD cup â€˜99, NSL-KDD, UNSW_NB15.
- ðŸ¤” [Awesome Machine Learning](https://github.com/goldboy225/awesome-machine-learning): A curated list of awesome Machine Learning frameworks, libraries and software.
- ðŸ“« [Awesome ML for Cybersecurity](https://github.com/goldboy225/awesome-ml-for-cybersecurity): A curated list of amazingly awesome tools and resources related to the use of machine learning for cyber security.
